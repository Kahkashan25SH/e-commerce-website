üéâ Marketplace Technical Foundation Day 2 Task Completed! üöÄ

I have successfully completed the Day 2 task of the Marketplace Technical Foundation. This task involved building the frontend using Next.js and the backend with Sanity CMS, along with seamlessly integrating third-party APIs to create an efficient and dynamic e-commerce website.

Highlights:

üõ†Ô∏è Frontend: Developed with Next.js for fast and interactive UI/UX. üì¶ Backend: Integrated Sanity CMS for robust content management. üåê API Integration: Connected all necessary links to third-party APIs to ensure functionality and data flow. üõí E-commerce Features: Implemented core features for a smooth and responsive shopping experience. This project was a fantastic opportunity to enhance my skills in modern web development technologies while focusing on creating a scalable and efficient marketplace solution.

Looking forward to more challenges and learning opportunities ahead! üòä

üéâ Marketplace Technical Foundation Day 4 Task Completed! üöÄ

Day 4 Task: E-commerce Website Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Sanity CMS Description: In this task, I have developed a fully functional E-commerce Website using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Sanity CMS. The website is designed to provide an interactive user experience with a dynamic product listing and detailed product pages.make many reuseable componenets.

Key Features: Next.js with TypeScript:

The website is built using Next.js, a React framework, for seamless server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). The application is structured with TypeScript to enhance the development process with type safety. Tailwind CSS:

Tailwind CSS is used for utility-first styling, ensuring a highly customizable and responsive design for the e-commerce platform. Sanity CMS:

Sanity CMS is integrated for content management, allowing easy management of product data. It is used to fetch product information dynamically, such as images, prices, and details, from a headless CMS. Dynamic Routing:

I have implemented dynamic routing for product pages. Each product is displayed dynamically based on its unique ID, enabling a clean and scalable URL structure. Reusable Components:

The website includes several reusable components, including a product card, product detail page, and product list. This modular approach ensures that the website is maintainable and easy to extend in the future. Responsive Design:

The website is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) to ensure a consistent and smooth user experience across all devices. Tasks Completed: Product Listing Page: A dynamic product listing page that fetches data from Sanity CMS and displays products with their images, names, and prices. Product Detail Page: Each product has its own dedicated page showing detailed information, including product images, description, and price. Reusable Components: Components like product cards, buttons, and layouts are reusable, making the site easy to maintain and expand.

Marketplace Bulider Hackathon 2025 Day5: Day5-Task: Testing Error Handling and Backend Integration Refinment Document. E-Commerce Website with Next.js and Sanity CMS This project is an e-commerce platform built during Day 5 of a hackathon. The application is designed using Next.js for the frontend and Sanity CMS for content management. The platform includes a range of features like product fetching, dynamic cart management, error handling, and optimized loading states.

Features

Dynamic Product Management Products are fetched dynamically from Sanity CMS. Real-time updates in the CMS reflect directly on the website.
API Integration APIs are used to fetch product data from Sanity CMS. Handled scenarios like network issues or missing product data gracefully with error messages and fallback content.
Cart Management Add, remove, and update products in the cart. Persistent cart data using browser storage (local storage or session storage). Validation for product quantities to ensure accurate cart updates.
Error Handling Implemented user-friendly error messages for: Product Not Found: Displayed when a product is missing from the database. API Errors: Clear feedback to users when API calls fail due to network issues. Cart Management Errors: Prevent invalid operations like adding out-of-stock products.
Loading States Skeleton loaders and spinners for a smooth user experience while fetching data. Different loading indicators for: Product pages. Cart operations. API interactions. Technologies Used Frontend Next.js: React-based framework for server-side rendering and static site generation. Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling. Content Management Sanity CMS: Headless CMS for managing and delivering content. State Management Context API for managing global state (e.g., cart data). Local storage for cart persistence. Challenges and Solutions (use many other labriers)
API Network Issues Problem: Delays or failures in fetching data from the CMS. Solution: Implemented retry logic for API calls. Displayed fallback content when the API fails. Logged errors for easier debugging.
Product Not Found Problem: Missing or deleted products in Sanity CMS. Solution: Added conditional rendering to display an error message if a product is not found. Redirected users to a fallback page for a better experience.
Cart Management Errors Problem: Issues like adding unavailable products or invalid cart updates. Solution: Validated product availability before adding to the cart. Added alerts for operations like exceeding stock limits.
Loading State Management Problem: Lack of visual feedback during API calls caused confusion. Solution: Integrated skeleton loaders for product pages. Used spinners and disabled buttons during cart operations. Home Page Home Page Home Page


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
